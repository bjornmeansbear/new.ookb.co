Kristian Bjørnard is a designer, thinker, educator, and sustainabilitist. He is the director of “The Office of Kristian Bjørnard,” a boutique design studio focused on publishing in all its forms. Kristian holds an MFA in Graphic Design from MICA and a BA in Studio Art from Kalamazoo College. 

Having explored physics and mathematics before funneling his time into painting, Kristian holds an interest in the underlying function of things never. Once filtered through the lens of the visual this interest eventually led him to the field of design. Kristian brings this thinking into the classroom, drawing ties and comparisons between science and philosophy to the discipline and practice of design.

Current design research covers “sustainable graphic design” and new forms of publishing systems. This has led to a more purposeful interest into what systems mean when integrated into design, reusable processes, a focus on rules-based design concepts, the generation of personal “sustainable” aesthetic exercises, and investigating what we can learn from vernacular design methodologies. 

Kristian also explores various aspects of time and motion as they relate to graphic design and keeps abreast of current web trends, standards, and technologies. All of these interests: systems, sustainability, motion, publishing, contemporary web technology, etc.; make for interesting insights and connections when discussing and working on projects in both the classroom and in his professional practice.
