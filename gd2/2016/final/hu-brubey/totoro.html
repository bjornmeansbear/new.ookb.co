                    <p><b>Description:</b> Two young girls, Satsuki and her younger sister Mei, move into a house in the country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. Satsuki and Mei discover that the nearby forest is inhabited by magical creatures called Totoros (pronounced toe-toe-ro). They soon befriend these Totoros, and have several magical adventures.</p>
                    <p><b>Why?</b> I remember the first time watching it was with my mother when I was probably 5 or 6. Totoro, a creature with huge furry body, will only appear by chance.  I wanted to meet Totoro and make friends with him really badly when I was a kid. Totoro seems to be happy all the time, living in no-worry life.  I watched this film again when I got a little older. It cured me just like before. </p>
