                    <p><b>Description:</b> In Georgian England, Mrs. Bennet raises her five daughters - Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia with the purpose of getting married with a rich husband that can support the family. They are not from the upper class, and their house in Hertfordshire will be inherited by a distant cousin if Mr. Bennet dies. When the wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley and his best friend Mr. Darcy arrive in town to spend the summer in a mansion nearby their property, the shy and beautiful Jane falls in love for Mr. Bingley, and Lizzie finds Mr. Darcy a snobbish and proud man, and she swears to loathe him forever. This is the beginning of their wonderful love story.</p>
                    <p><b>Why?</b> This version of Pride and Prejudice is such a classic movie with new faces. I have not got a chance to read the book yet, but the movie itself definitely makes me want to read the book. Jane Austin’s depiction of English countryside 200 years ago is lively illustrated by the director using some long shots. Every character’s personality are clearly drawn out. </p>
