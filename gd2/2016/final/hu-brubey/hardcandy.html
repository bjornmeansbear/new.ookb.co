                    <p><b>Description:</b> After three weeks of chatting with the thirty-two year old photographer Jeff Kohlver over the Internet, fourteen year old Hayley Stark meets him in the Nighthawks coffee shop. Hayley flirts with him in spite of the age difference and proposes to go to his house. Once there, she prepares a screwdriver for them and Jeff passes out. When he awakes, he is tied up to a chair, and Hayley accuses him of pedophilia. Jeff denies the accusation, and Hayley begins to torture him in a cat and mouse game. </p>
                    <p><b>Why?</b> This film definitely has a strange plot. At the beginning, I was really worried about this teenage girl going to a stranger’s house alone. However, the plot twists real quick that I totally did not expect. Hayley keeps aggressively asking Jeff questions about his first love Janelle and Jeff keeps lying and asking for mercy. I am impressed by how Hayley, being a teenager, takes this revenge on Jeff for abusing her friend.  </p>
