                    <p><b>Description:</b> Amélie is a story about a girl named Amélie whose childhood was suppressed by her Father's mistaken concerns of a heart defect. With these concerns Amélie gets hardly any real life contact with other people. This leads Amélie to resort to her own fantastical world and dreams of love and beauty. She later on becomes a young woman and moves to the central part of Paris as a waitress. After finding a lost treasure belonging to the former occupant of her apartment, she decides to return it to him. After seeing his reaction and his new found perspective - she decides to devote her life to the people around her. Such as, her father who is obsessed with his garden-gnome, a failed writer, a hypochondriac, a man who stalks his ex girlfriends, the "ghost", a suppressed young soul, the love of her life and a man whose bones are as brittle as glass. But after consuming herself with these escapades - she finds out that she is disregarding her own life and damaging her quest for love. Amélie then discovers she must become more aggressive and take a hold of her life and capture the beauty of love she has always dreamed of.</p>
                    <p><b>Why?</b> I like every part of this film, including the plot, characters, color, soundtrack, details, director’s sense of humor, and etc (except the poster because I thought it was a horror movie when I saw it). First of all, I am personally influenced by Amelie a lot. Her kindness and imagination plays an important role throughout this film, which I find like a healing power. Moreover, the two colors occurs through the whole movie are red and green. I believe the director used Kodak film that creates the dreamy effect. A fun thing is that I actually heard the soundtrack that my mother bought first and started to be interested in the film itself. Now the soundtrack become the major instrumental music I will listen to over and over again. </p>
