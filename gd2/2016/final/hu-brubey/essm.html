                    <p><b>Description:</b> Joel is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contracts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik, to have Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get her out of his head.</p>
                    <p><b>Why?</b> People are lonely so they seek for someone who they can accompany with. The fate, determines the two persons who are meant to be together to be together. The two characters choose to forget each other, but finally even when they don’t have any memory about each other, they are still attracted to each other. I always believe everyone’s fate has been planned out already when one was born. Also, I love how imaginative the director is, especially in Joel’s dream that he is about to forget but trying not to. It is also ironic how people finally know to cherish something when they lose something.  </p>
