                    <p><b>Description:</b> Elizabeth's heart is broken. For solace, she drops in late at night a few times at Jeremy's diner for blueberry pie a la mode; they talk. Once, he watches her sleep, her head on the counter. Abruptly, she leaves New York City to get away from her pain. She works a couple of jobs in Memphis. There, a heart-broken cop is drinking himself into oblivion, his ex occasionally showing up where he drinks and Lizzy works. Then, she's in Nevada, working at a casino where she uses her savings (she wants a car) to stake Leslie, a busted gambler, in a high rollers' game. After, Beth drives Leslie to Vegas where Leslie's estranged father lives. Broken relationships. What about Jeremy?</p>
                    <p><b>Why?</b> Life is a journey from which we can always learn things. I really hope to take a journey without purpose some day, meet random individuals and learn from every single scene like Elizabeth does. My favorite scene in the entire film is after Elizabeth buys the car, she and Leslie wave goodbye at the crossroad in highway. Kar-wai Wong’s successful use of the light, the camera and the background music worked together and generated an intense atmosphere of separation. Then she comes back to the town where she had suffered before, with a totally different mood. Her expression in her eyes of saying goodbye to the apartment where her ex-boyfriend used to live is no longer depressed and angry, instead, she can smile at this “painful memory” at this point.</p>
