			<h1>GAMES OF THE YEAR</h1>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			Video Games have been one of the most influential forms of media in my personal life. Looking back on the past decade of my life, each year has been defined by the games I have experienced. Whether it's finding something to do while stranded in a hurricane or simply having a game to connect with my brother over.

					<h1>Monster Hunter 4U</h1>
					<h2>2015</h2>
					<p>One of the absolute best multiplayer games for the 3DS, Monster Hunter 4U was the defining game of 2015 for me. If there's anything to blame for me not getting thesis done, this is probably a very culpable suspect. The fact that I was able to play for hours on end along with the ability to pick it up anytime just made this game so convenient to play with my studio-mates.</p>

				<a href="#2014"><img src="images/x2014.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>Left 4 Dead 2</h1>
					<h2>2014</h2>
					<p>Despite coming out back in 2012, Left 4 Dead 2 was probably my most played game of 2014, and is still my longest played game on Steam. Most of that can be attributed to playing almost every evening during that summer. It was a fun yet challenging game to play with my group of church friends back home.</p>

			<div class="game" id="2013">
				<a href="#2013"><img src="images/x2013.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>Borderlands 2</h1>
					<h2>2013</h2>
					<p>I picked up Borderlands 2 on sale, about a year after it came out. It was one of those games that I really got into with my roommate Sluke. It was a really awesome blend of RPG and FPS gameplay that made it really enjoyable to play co-op. It was further enhanced because we both played such different styles of characters, and that was quite the unique experience.</p>

				<a href="#2012"><img src="images/x2012.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>Killing Floor</h1>
					<h2>2012</h2>
					<p>I didn't play too many games during my freshman year at MICA. I tried to keep myself focused and whatever on my work. But one of my most memorable moments of that year was marathoning this game for hours on end during Hurricane Sandy. We were expecting to be shut into our dorm for the weekend, so we ended up stockpiling a bunch of food and just trucking through this game all throughout the storm.</p>

			<div class="game" id="2011">
				<a href="#2011"><img src="images/x2011.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>League of Legends</h1>
					<h2>2011</h2>
					<p>Back in my senior year of high school, this game was nowhere near as big as it is today. It was a niche game which I'd picked up from a couple of friends. It was my first real experience playing competitive team-based games online. Of course, with it being senior year, I ended up spending more time on this game than I ever did doing any work that year.</p>

			<div class="game" id="2010">
				<a href="#2010"><img src="images/x2010.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>Pokemon Soulsilver</h1>
					<h2>2010</h2>
					<p>Around this time of my life, my family moved around a lot. There was a period of time around freshman and sophomore year of high school where we didn't have internet at home because of that. Something a lot of the games in this list have in common are that they are mostly multiplayer games I played with friends. A lot of my time was spent playing this game when I'd be home with nothing else really to do.</p>

			<div class="game" id="2009">
				<a href="#2009"><img src="images/x2009.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>BYOND</h1>
					<h2>2009</h2>
					<p>This isn't really a game itself so to speak, but it was an open sourced game building platform. It was used to create simple 2D sprite based games to RP with other people online. It was what got me interested in game design, sprite animation and coding. Looking back, I'm still pretty proud of a lot of the games I made back then. A lot of my work nowadays is still heavily inspired from back then.</p>

			<div class="game" id="2008">
				<a href="#2008"><img src="images/x2008.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</h1>
					<h2>2008</h2>
					<p>Despite there being two earlier installations of this game, this was the first one I was able to play with friends on a consistent basis. I remember my friend getting it the day it came out, and we all just stayed over at his house all night to marathon through the games' story mode. It's definitely one of the best multiplayer games on the Wii as well.</p>

			<div class="game" id="2007">
				<a href="#2007"><img src="images/x2007.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess</h1>
					<h2>2007</h2>
					<p>In November 2007, I was able to get a Wii console as both a birthday present as well as it being my first console. With it, I bought this game as it was one of the most hyped release games at the time. Being in middle school at the time, I wasn't the most clever kid. I remember spending most of my winter break trying to get through that game with my brother helping me. We would huddle in blankets on the couch with a printed GameFaqs guide spread on the table.</p>

			<div class="game" id="2006">
				<a href="#2006"><img src="images/x2006.jpg"></a>
				<div class="text">
					<h1>Maplestory</h1>
					<h2>2006</h2>
					<p>In what can only be called "The Dark Ages" of my life, most of my time was spent on the computer, playing this game. I'd come home from school, make a bowl of ramen, and play until I went to sleep. The one bright side of it though, was that I made several friends that I still keep in touch with even today. </p>
