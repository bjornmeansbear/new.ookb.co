        <p><b>Book Reviews:</b></p>

        <blockquote>"The biblical characters -- both the tiny, long-lived humans and the angels -- are considerably more interesting than the twins; even the animal characters have more personality. The main characters, Sandy and Dennys, spend a good part of this book just recovering from sunburn, being tended by members of Noah's family. When Sandy and Dennys do speak, they tend to state the perfectly obvious.

<p>Eventually, readers are pulled into the struggle between angels and fallen angels, the ageless battle between good and evil that is at the heart of all the Chronos Quartet stories. Madeleine L'Engle raises the interesting questions of what part the twins will play in the battle, and what will happen to Yalith, whom they both love. This is not conventional storytelling, but it has its own rewards."</p> <p>- Cindy Kane, Common Sense Media</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Sandy and Dennys, twins and middle children in the Newbery-winning A Wrinkle in Time, are transported to the time just before the Flood. With a Finn grounding in Genesis, this is the kind of intricate tale with complex characters and relationships that L'Engle's readers have come to expect. Her ancient world of desert and oasis are stark in their simplicity, yet the evils precipitating the Flood mirror today's. Old customs are flouted; even Noah has quarreled with his father, and young women are wedding nephilim, biblical "giants in the earth," drawn here as fallen angels who change from man to beast at will.</p> <p>The boys, 15, become compassionate participants in preflood events, helping where they can (they reconcile Noah with his father) but always aware that they're "not supposed to change the story." Poignantly, they realize that the flood failed in the long term; human nature is the same. Noah was before Babel; L'Engle's universal "Old Language" is spare, direct, without colloquialisms. Her reiterated descriptions--baboons clapping at dawn, the brilliance of the singing stars--lend a mythic timelessness to the setting. A carefully wrought fable, entwining disparate elements from unicorns to particle physics, this will be enjoyed for its suspense and humor as well as its other levels of meaning."<p>-Kirkus Reviews</p></blockquote>
