# 2013 Summer.

1. Cleanup Dropbox, Github, and Aegir servers.

2. SuperSimple, CAPE.io, WebsiteDumper.
How do OOKB and SundaysEnergy collaborate on these things? Is SuperSimple ready to be updated to the new design? Is CAPE ready to be “sold” to clients/users?

The real question is how to work on this stuff, how do i(we) make money from them, and how are they managed — are these all sundaysenergy properties that I just help on, or is there a new parent company — maybe the Labori.us moniker from before — that is the “Owner.”

3. OOKB projects / OOKB clients
a) Rogers and Goffigon - confirmed
b) Clapp Communications - awaiting
c) Mamu Media (recurring) - confirmed
d) Deutsch Foundation - awaiting
e) Contemporary Museum - confirmed
f) Design#Code - awaiting
g) CityBizList (recurring) - should I hold onto this client?
------
a) is with Kai, and potentially Emma and/or Jackson
b) and d) will be a little with Kai and a lot with Emma, or perhaps Jackson.
c) With Jackson over the summer
e) Me, but a lot of collaboration with Deana, and a little help from Jenna.
f) I'll do this with some help from Young Sun, at least design/build of the site wise… for the video, depending on how this happens, I'll have to pull in some others, Vishnu perhaps, maybe Carpenter?
g) Just me...

4. Green Acres Web Book.

5. Other book projects.
a) Finish Tim's book
b) Laura Hudson book?
c) Deana's police hut project book?
d) 365 book
e) Sustainability stuff?
f) What else can I find?
