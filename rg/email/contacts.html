      <h2>Importing your Contacts</h2>
      <p>To import your contacts, first visit <a href="http://gmail.rogersandgoffigon.com">gmail.rogersandgoffigon.com</a> and login with your email and password. If you had accessible contacts in your old email account you will have been sent a vcd file with all your old contacts. The email is titled "Your Contacts for Importing." Please download the attached YOURNAME.vcd file to your computer. Now, look in the upper left corner of your inbox window where it says "Mail." Click on "Mail" and choose "Contacts" from the dropdown menu that appears. This takes you to the contacts browser. It will probably be empty. To the right of "Contacts" look for the "More" button. Click on "More" and choose "Import" from the dropdown menu. This opens a popup window titled "Import Contacts". Click on the button that says "Browse." This should open a window where you can search your computer for your contact files. Find and then choose the YOURNAME.vcd file you were sent via email and downloaded. Click "open." Now click "Import." This should add your contacts from the previos system to the new google system.</p>
