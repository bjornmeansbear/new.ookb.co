              After  assembling  mock  assault  rifles  out  of  everyday  found  objects,  sculptor  David  Hess  goes  on  the  road  to  explore  America's  obsession  with  guns.  When  ordinary  citizens  are  allowed  to  handle  these  weapons,  a  fresh  and  meaningful  dialogue  results.  Gun  Show  is  a  film  about  the  power  of  art  to  advance  a  conversation  on  a  subject  of  dire  importance.

            <h1>David Hess</h1>
            <p>
              David Hess works mostly with found materials. The materials he finds, he refers to as rescued objects; they are loaded with history and cultural narrative. At Dartmouth College, Hess studied with the realist wood sculptor Fumio Yoshimura, whose precision and humor had a profound impact on Hess. Hess’s interests in science, engineering and narrative filmmaking also inform his sculpture. Frequently, he explores a precarious balance of elements poised on the verge movement. Hess is represented in Baltimore by Goya Contemporary Gallery. His work can be found in numerous private and public collections including the collections of American Visionary Art Museum, Baltimore Museum of Industry, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Sinai Hospital, Thurgood Marshall Airport, Kaiser-Permanente and the Emerson Corporation. In addition, Hess has completed over twenty public art commissions.
